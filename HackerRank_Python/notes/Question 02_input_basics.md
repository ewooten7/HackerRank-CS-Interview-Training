# 🚀 HackerRank Concept Journal — Day 1

## 🧠 Topic: Python Input, Imports, and Main Block

- `input()` → get user input (string)
- `.strip()` → remove newline & whitespace
- `int(...)` → cast to integer (Converts string to integer)

- `import math, os, random, re, sys` → available modules (remove unused):
    import math	    Adds math functions like sqrt, pow
    import os	    OS-level file and path access
    import random	Random numbers, shuffling
    import re	    Regular expressions
    import sys	    System input/output, arguments

- `Modulus %` → calculates the remainder of a division operation between two numbers.

- `__name__ == '__main__'` → ensures main block only runs on direct file execution
    - Runs only when file is executed directly

🔍 Analogy:
- `.strip()` trims like scissors — gets rid of extra paper on the edges.
    - Cleans whitespace (start/end) from string

- `__name__ == '__main__'` keeps files modular and safe when imported.

✅ Code Snippet:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input().strip())

        if n % 2 != 0: #HOW to check in COMPUTER LANGUAGE if a number is EVEN or ODD; remainder MUST be 0 or its ODD when divited by 2.
            
    elif 2 <= 5: #HOW to CREATE number RANGES
        
    elif 6 <= n <= 20: #HOW to do IN-BETWEEN Ranges
